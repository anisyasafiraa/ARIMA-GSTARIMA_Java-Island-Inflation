# ARIMA-GSTARIMA for Inflation Prediction in Java Island
Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy that is usually measured using the consumer price index. Indonesia's inflation rate has been fluctuating these years, and the increases and decreases of its rate have a similar pattern to each province's inflation in Java Island. Thus, here I used ARIMA and GSTARIMA to get the inflation value prediction for each province on Java Island. ARIMA and GSTARIMA are methods that are usually used to do time series forecasting hence a stationary test is needed before modeling.

All model combinations using ARIMA are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iS__VAdKHEhGUE1g9GiD43Q-Kk6FV8sD/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104946118082374534733&rtpof=true&sd=true).
