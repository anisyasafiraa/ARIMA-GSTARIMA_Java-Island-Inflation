# ARIMA-GSTARIMA for Inflation Prediction in Java Island
Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy that is usually measured using the consumer price index. Indonesia's inflation rate has been fluctuating these years, and the increases and decreases of its rate have a similar pattern to each province's inflation in Java Island. Thus, here I used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Space-Time ARIMA (GSTARIMA) to get the inflation rate prediction of each province on Java Island.
